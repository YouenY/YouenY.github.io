    <description><![CDATA[Overall description of RNA-Seq The transcriptome has a high degree of complexity including multiple types of coding and non-coding RNA species, like mRNA, pre-mRNA, microRNA, and long ncRNA. To understand how the expression of a gene affects translation to proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules were the most frequently studied RNA species. Besides coding RNA, noncoding RNA molecules also play significant roles in cellular functions: Ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs are involved in mRNA translation.]]></description>
