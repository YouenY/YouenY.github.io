Concatenation of raw read files First of all, the operating system (OS) I used is Linux Ubuntu 20.04.4. And what I have in my hand are 64 raw read fastq.gz files. What we need to do first is to concatenate 4 files into one, for example: File name (before) File name(after) LAB_273_17_…_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz LAB_273_17_R1.fastq.gz LAB_273_17_…_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz LAB_273_17_…_L003_R1_001.fastq.gz LAB_273_17_…_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz in Linux, open the terminal for name in *.fastq.gz; do printf '%s\\n' \"${name%_*_*_R[12]*}\" done | uniq | while read prefix; do cat \"$prefix\"*R1*.fastq.gz \u003e\"${prefix}_R1.fastq.gz\" cat \"$prefix\"*R2*.fastq.gz \u003e\"${prefix}_R2.fastq.gz\" done Then check whether they are concatenated or not.
