    <description><![CDATA[How DESeq2 calculate DEGs? DESeq2 tool was published in 2014 and it has been cited more than 30,000 times. (reference)
 DESeq2 is a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve the stability and interpretability of estimates.
 Library normalization by DEGs (median of ratios method) RPKM, FPKM, TPM&hellip;&hellip; Those are methods for adjusting for the difference in overall read counts among libraries.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Summary  In this section, we are going to install trimgalore and trim the merged read files to improve the qualities of read files.   1. Why do we need to trim?  Quality trimming decreases the overall number of reads, but increases to the total and proportion of uniquely mapped reads. Thus, you get more useful data for downstream analyses. Too aggressive quality trimming can negatively impact downstream analysis.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Summary  In this section, we are going to map the read files to genome index using STAR, perform QC with Qualimap, and obtain count data using featureCounts.   1. installation of STAR  Pl ease refer to this official manual

    <description><![CDATA[Summary  In this section, we are going to concatenate 4 read files from the same sample into 1 file and perform Fastqc, multiqc, and Trim_galore to check the quality of each read data.   1     1. Concatenation of raw read files First of all, the operating system (OS) I used is Linux Ubuntu 20.04.4. And what I have in my hand are 64 raw read fastq.]]></description>
