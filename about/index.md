# About me


# Welcome to this personal blog! :wave:



### Who am I?
* :man_scientist:I'm a Ph.D. candidate in <span style="color:pink;">Human Biology at the University of Tsukuba</span>, advised by <span style="color:pink;">Prof. Akiyoshi Fukamizu</span> in biochemistry and molecular biology, and <span style="color:pink;">Prof. Yasuteru Shigeta</span> in computational sciences. My research, bridging atomic-level analysis and animal model studies, focuses on protein dynamics' role in biological functions and health.

### Research Ability

My research philosophy,**<span style="color:red;">"The Experimental-Theoretical Symphony,"</span>**  reflects my dedication to integrating experimental biology with theoretical and computational approaches to uncover the complexities of biological systems.

***in vitro***: 

- Utilization of Escherichia coli for protein expression, crafting mutant proteins to conduct **<span style="color:pink;">*in vitro*</span>** **<span style="color:pink;">activity assays</span>**. 
- Measure binding affinities using **<span style="color:pink;">Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)</span>** 
- Complementing these studies with quantitative analysis of reaction products through **<span style="color:pink;">LC-MS/MS</span>**.

***in silico***: 

- Employing **<span style="color:pink;">molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</span>** to model protein-protein interactions, serving to corroborate results obtained from **<span style="color:pink;">*in vitro*</span>** **<span style="color:pink;">activity assays</span>**.
- Developing **<span style="color:pink;">extensive scripts for molecular docking simulations</span>** aimed at high-throughput screening of protein-small molecule interactions, which enables the systematic exploration of potential binding partners.
- Advancing **<span style="color:pink;">RNA-seq analytical workflows</span>** through the creation of automated scripts for quality control, trimming, mapping, and extraction of reads data from large datasets of fastq files. 
- Conducting **<span style="color:pink;">comprehensive downstream RNA-seq analysis using R programming</span>**. This includes processing data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and performing Gene Ontology (GO) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). 
- Analyzing RNA-seq data through **<span style="color:pink;">Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)</span>** to construct co-expressed gene networks for genes of interest. 

***in vivo:***

- Oversee the breeding and maintenance of mice
- Proficiency in **<span style="color:pink;">mouse dissection</span>**, enabling detailed anatomical studies and precise organ and tissue collection
- Performing **<span style="color:pink;">extractions of proteins, RNA, and DNA</span>** from organ tissues and cells
- Conducting **<span style="color:pink;">quantitative PCR (qPCR)</span>** to assess gene expression levels
- Skilled in **<span style="color:pink;">Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blotting techniques</span>**
- Extracting **<span style="color:pink;">embryonic fibroblasts</span>** from mouse embryos
- Carry out **<span style="color:pink;">cell staining and assays</span>** to evaluate cellular characteristics and functions


### Objective of this blog
The objective of this blog is to **<span style="color:red;">share the various scripts and codes</span>** I have developed during my RNA-seq and protein simulation projects. By documenting the challenges encountered, including bugs and their resolutions, I aim to provide insights and practical solutions to fellow researchers navigating similar computational analyses.
