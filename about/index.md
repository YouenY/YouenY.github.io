# About me


# Hi! Welcome to this personal blog! :wave:

### Who am I?
* :man_scientist: I'm a student doing fundamental research in a molecular biology lab in Japan. I used transgenic mice :mouse: as well as cells to analyze unknown functions of proteins.   
* I have a dream of experimental :alembic: -theoretical :computer: collaboration! I want to generate a multi-scale analysis from the atomistic level to the animal model. 

### Education
:baby: Born in Shanghai, China  
:school_satchel: Graduated from Shanghai High School  
:school: Graduated from the University of Tsukuba (Bachelor's degree)  
:sweat_drops: 5-year doctoral program in the University of Tsukuba (current)


### Why I generate this personal blog?
I'm a student who has a strong interest in the field of Bioinformatics! :grin: Although I have no background in programming, and no concept of NGS, I have patience and passion. I'm very lucky that my lab supports me with powerful computing resources that I can easily start my dry analysis from 0. Thanks to several professors in Bioinformatics Lab for supporting me. 

In this blog, I aim to:  

* Generate protocols for Bioinformatics analysis  
* Record the problems and difficulties I met and the solutions for them
* Note new idea and knowledge from papers

### Hobby :dart:
* :basketball:  Basketball
* :musical_keyboard:  Piano
* :video_game: Video games
* :robot: Gundam
